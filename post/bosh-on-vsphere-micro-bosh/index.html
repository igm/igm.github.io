It is used to manage VMs in AWS and vSphere. The vSphere option seemed to be interesting to me and the idea of having private Cloud Foundry PaaS running locally on private infrastructure was exciting. The BOSH is under heavy development and it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to make things work easily even if following various tutorials and blogs and I&rsquo;m very thankful to the authors.</p><h2 id=vsphere-setup>vSphere Setup</h2><p>As an infrastructure I created a cluster of 4 hosts ESXi version 5u1 (esxi1, esxi2, esxi3, esxi4) registered in igmlab.net domain (i.e. esxi1.igmlab.net). All of the hosts were powered by four core CPU wih 16GB of RAM and iSCSI shared storage (IET software based) of 512GB. The internal network had following characteristics: IP range: 192.168.2.0/24, GW/DNS: 192.168.2.107. For VMware vCenter Server SUSE based VM appliance was used (verion 5.0.0).</p><p>Proper network configuration is crucial for correct deployment. Bosh VMs run as guests in ESXi hosts and they access those hosts directly so both the hosts and guests have to share the same network. This is also the case for vCenter Server.</p><h2 id=micro-bosh>Micro Bosh</h2><p>To deploy Bosh you need Bosh. It&rsquo;s kind of like to get a compiler you need to compile one first. Luckily there&rsquo;s a special one called &ldquo;micro Bosh&rdquo; and it can be installed by Bosh CLI addon called Bosh Deployer. So first things first, let&rsquo;s start with Bosh CLI. The current version at the time of writing is 0.9.14. Ruby people should not have any problems installing it via gem install bosh_cli. More detailed instructions are here. The next step is to install Bosh Deployer. For trouble-less installation Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS Server is suggested. The steps:</p><pre><code>$ gem install bosh_cli
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh.git
$ cd bosh/deployer
$ bundle install
$ rake install
$ rbenv rehash
$ bosh
usage: bosh [--verbose] [--config|-c &lt;FILE&gt;] [--cache-dir &lt;DIR]
            [--force] [--no-color] [--skip-director-checks] [--quiet]
            [--non-interactive]
            command [&lt;args&gt;]
...

  micro deployment [&lt;name&gt;] Choose micro deployment to work with 
  micro status              Display micro BOSH deployment status 
  micro deployments         Show the list of deployments 
  micro deploy &lt;stemcell&gt;   Deploy a micro BOSH instance to the currently 
                            selected deployment 
                            --update   update existing instance 
  micro delete              Delete micro BOSH instance (including 
                            persistent disk) 
  micro agent &lt;args&gt;        Send agent messages 
  micro apply &lt;spec&gt;        Apply spec
</code></pre><p>Next we need micro bosh deployment manifest. In the manifest the deployment configuration is stored. The defaults for vSphere can be found in the repository and the manifest for micro Bosh deployment looks like this:</p><p>We need to create deployments directory to store our deployment manifest files.</p><p>Micro Bosh Stemcell is a VM template that will be used for our deployment. Deployment manifests define the details that are configured in the VM so that all the network configuration is set properly. It also contains details about the vSphere setup, vCenter connection parameters, resource parameters for VM etc. To get a full list of available Bosh stemcells run:</p><p>At this moment we are interested in micro stemcell (micro-bosh-stemcell-0.1.0.tgz) and we need to download it:</p><p>As soon as we have required stemcell and manifest we can start the deployment procedure:</p><p>Entire process takes several minutes (~20 minutes in my case):</p><p>Now we can target the micro bosh and login with default admin/admin:</p><p>You should also be able to ssh to the micro Bosh:</p><p>The password &lsquo;vmware&rsquo; is what we provided in our manifest in env:bosh:password. You can also generate hash for custom password:</p><p>and use it instead before deploying micro Bosh. And if you think this is all you wanted to do you can delete the deployment:</p><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>var disqus_config=function(){this.page.url="https://blog.igormihalik.com",this.page.identifier="/post/bosh-on-vsphere-micro-bosh/"};(function(){var a=document,b=a.createElement('script');b.src='//igormihalik.disqus.com/embed.js',b.setAttribute('data-timestamp',+new Date),(a.head||a.body).appendChild(b)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div><script type=text/javascript src=//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=//code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fancybox/1.3.4/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript>$(function(a){var b=!1,c=!0,d='inside';a(b?'img':'img.fancybox').each(function(){var b=a(this),c=b.attr('title'),d=b.attr('data-big')||b.attr('src'),e=a('<a href="#" class="fancybox"></a>').attr('href',d).attr('title',c);b.wrap(e)}),c&&a('a.fancybox').attr('rel','fancyboxgallery'),a('a.fancybox').fancybox({titlePosition:d})}),$.noConflict()</script></body></html>
