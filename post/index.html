May 2015)</li><p>Cloud Foundry is one of many options to host your applications. It is a PaaS originally developed by VMware, now governed by <a href=http://cloudfoundry.org target=_blank>Cloud Foundry Foundation</a>. Not going much into details about where, how and what as those information is publicly available I&rsquo;ll focus here on how to host your GO applications on any Cloud Foundry installation including <a href=http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry target=_blank>PCF</a> or <a href=http://run.pivotal.io/ target=_blank>PWS</a>.</p><li><a href=https://blog.igormihalik.com/post/>Posts</a> (26.

May 2013)</li><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since implementing <a href=https://blog.igormihalik.com/post/sockjs-for-go/ target=_blank>SockJS library for Go</a>. Since then I learned couple of new things about the language and runtime. So here I&rsquo;ll try to summarise what it was.</p><li><a href=https://blog.igormihalik.com/post/sockjs-for-go/>SockJS for Go</a> (11. Dec 2012)</li><p><a href=https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client target=_blank>SockJS</a> is a browser JavaScript library that provides a WebSocket-like object. SockJS gives you a coherent, cross-browser, Javascript API which creates a low latency, full duplex, cross-domain communication channel between the browser and the web server. Under the hood SockJS tries to use native WebSockets first. If that fails it can use a variety of browser-specific transport protocols and presents them through WebSocket-like abstractions.</p><li><a href=https://blog.igormihalik.com/post/golang/>go get...</a> (06. Sep 2012)</li><p>Recently I came across a programming language called <a href=http://golang.org/ target=_blank>GO</a>. At first I was a little skeptical about it, why another language? I spent most of my IT life in Java world, occasionally touching other languages (Ruby, C++, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, Scala, Erlang &mldr;) but GO really got my attention.</p><li><a href=https://blog.igormihalik.com/post/bosh-on-vsphere-micro-bosh/>BOSH on vSphere (micro Bosh)</a> (28. Jun 2012)</li><p>Recently I spent some time playing with BOSH which is a tool for <a href=https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh target=_blank>release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services</a>. It is used to manage VMs in AWS and vSphere. The vSphere option seemed to be interesting to me and the idea of having private <a href=http://cloudfoundry.org/ target=_blank>Cloud Foundry</a> PaaS running locally on private infrastructure was exciting. The BOSH is under heavy development and it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to make things work easily even if following various tutorials and <a href=http://drnicwilliams.com/2012/04/16/creating-a-bosh-from-scratch-on-aws/ target=_blank>blogs</a> and I&rsquo;m very thankful to the authors.</p><li><a href=https://blog.igormihalik.com/categories/>Categories</a> (01.
